Introduction

This HardwareLib project is meant as an example for using the ECC API with the
L2 Cache. This project uses a combination of the Cache, ECC, Interrupt, and MMU
API to demonstrate how to inject and receive notification of single bit error
(SERR) and double bit error (DERR) events. The MMU API is used to set up the
page tables to mark specific regions of memory used to scrub the L2 memory
associated with ECC protection and RAM to demonstrate the error injection. This
example only caches certain memory regions in order to better isolate all RAM
and cache operations needed to reliably inject errors. When the ECC is properly
setup for the L2, a SERR or DERR will trigger an interrupt. Injecting a SERR or
DERR in the L2 has some special considerations which are handled in this
example.

Furthermore, <Makefile> can be changed to enable/disable semihosting requirement,

If SEMIHOSTING ?= 0, then the code will be built without semihosting support.

If SEMIHOSTING ?= 1, then code will be build with semihosting support.

Source Files

The following are descriptions of the source and header files contained in this
project:

alt_ecc_scratch_ram_get.c

  This code snippet is appended to HardwareLib's alt_ecc.c in order to obtain
  the address and size of the scrubbing RAM, which is declared as a static
  variable.

main.c

  This file is the main glue for all the components. It uses the interrupt,
  MMU, cache, and ECC APIs to create a ECC event notification system. Then, it
  demonstrates the ECC single and double bit error injection and notification
  system. Finally everything is cleaned up properly.

socfpga_eccl2.{c,h}

  This file provides functions that encapsulates the ECC for L2 cache
  operations. It has functions to setup and cleanup the ECC and interrupt
  systems which allows for a callback to be made for ECC events. Also, it has
  functions to inject single and double bit errors for a specified memory.

socfpga_int.{c,h}

  This file provides functions to conveniently setup and cleanup the interrupt
  system.

socfpga_pagetable.{c,h}

  This file provides functions to conveniently setup and cleanup page table
  configurations using the MMU.

Launching the DS Debugger

1. DS must be launched from the SoC EDS Command Shell in order to have all
   environment variables properly set up.  Launch the SoC EDS Command Shell
   in Windows by selecting Altera <version> -> SoC Embedded Design Suite ->
   SoC EDS <version> Command Shell. In Linux, run embedded_command_shell.sh
   found in the linux64 directory. (Do not source the .sh, simply type its
   name at the prompt.)
2. A version of Quartus Prime must be installed in order for the DS debugger
   to function properly with the USB Blaster. A free version can be
   downloaded from the Altera website.
  2a. After launching the SoC EDS Command Shell, type "echo $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR"
      at the prompt.  This should be set to the quartus subdirectory of an
      install of the Quartus Prime tool.  If it is instead set to a qprogrammer/
      subdirectory, please reset it by typing the following command:
      export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=<path to quartus subdirectory>
      An example of what the path might look like is given below:
      export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR="C:/intelFPGA/20.1std/quartus/"
3. Type "armds_ide &" at the SoC EDS Command Shell prompt to launch the DS
   Debugger.
4. In Arm Development Studio IDE, right click inside the Projects pane, select Import..., then
   General -> Existing Projects into Workspace. Import the project as an
   archived file if it is still zipped and tarred, otherwise select the
   root directory it has be unzipped/untarred into.

=====

Building Example

Before running the example, the target executable first needs to be built.

1. In DS, build the application:
  1a. Switch to the C/C++ Perspective if not already in that perspective by
      selecting the menu: Window >> Open Perspective >> C/C++.
  1b. In the "Project Explorer" panel, right-mouse-click 
      "Altera-SoCFPGA-HardwareLib-ECCL2-CV-ARMCC" and select "Build Project".

The Console panel (bottom of the UI) should detail the progress of the build
and report any warnings or errors.

=====

System Setup

1. Connect the USB-BlasterII to the host computer.
2. Install the USB-BlasterII driver on the host computer if that driver is not
   already present. Consult documentation for QuartusII for instructions on
   installing the USB-BlasterII driver.
3. In DS, configure the launch configuration.
  3a. Select the menu: Run >> Debug Configurations...
  3b. In the options on the left, expand "DS Debugger" and select
      "Altera-SoCFPGA-HardwareLib-ECCL2-CV-ARMCC-Debug".
  3c. In the "Connections" section near the bottom, click Browse.
  3d. Select the appropriate USB-BlasterII to use. Multiple items will be
      presented if there is more than one USB-BlasterII connection attached to
      the host computer. These selections might take a few seconds to load.
  3e. Click "Apply" then "OK" to apply the USB-BlasterII selection.
  3f. Click "Close" to close the Debug Configuration. Otherwise click "Debug"
      run the example in the debugger.
  3g. If a prompt appears asking if you'd like to change to the debug
      perspective, click yes.

=====

Running the Example

After building the example and setting up the host computer system, the example
can be run by following these steps.

1. If semi-hosting is disabled, open a terminal session on the host computer to
   the serial port associated with the USB to serial bridge using a 8-N-1
   configuration (8 databits per frame, no parity, and 1 stopbit) at 115200 baud.
   If using the PuTTY terminal application, select Terminal in the Category pane
   and check "Implicit CR in every LF" to ensure proper formatting to the terminal.
   While not strictly necessary, the terminal will allow for interaction with the
   CLI. If semi-hosting is enabled, the output from print statements will be
   displayed in the "App Console" pane of the DS5 Debugger view.
2. In DS, launch the debug configuration.
  2a. Switch to the Debug Perspective if not already in that perspective by
      selecting the menu: Window >> Open Perspective >> DS Debug.
  2b. In the "Debug Control" panel, right-mouse-click
      "Altera-SoCFPGA-HardwareLib-ECCL2-CV-ARMCC-Debug" and select
      "Connect to Target".
3. Load the preloader, run the preloader to initialize the board
  2a. Load the preloader by running the command "loadfile <path_to_preloader>", and
      "restore <path_to_preloader_dtb> binary &_end" in the Commands tab
  2b. Set a hardware breakpoint at the point before preloader loads u-boot.img
      by running "thbreak spl_boot_device"
  2c. Set the debug entrypoint to preloader by running "set debug-from *$entrypoint"
  2d. Start running the preloader by typing "start", and then "continue" in the Commands
      tab
  2e. After the breakpoint has been hit, preloader have finished initializing the board
  2f. Discard the symbol file by running "discard-symbol-file <path_to_preloader>"
4. Load the examples
  3a. Run "load <path_to_application.axf>"
  3b. Run command "run" in the Command tab to run the application
5. To avoid warnings, disconnect from the target before making changes to the code
   and rebuilding.
